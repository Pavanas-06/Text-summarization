## Introduction
There is an huge amount of textual data, and it’s only growing every single minute.**
Think of the network which is comprised of several web pages, status, blogs, videos, articles and much more.
These kind of data is unstructured and the best thing that we can do is to navigate through the documents then search and skim the results. Nowadays Human beings have limited cognitive capacity for performing certain tasks.

## Cost and Features

### Cost
- 	Since the application can be used by all kinds of organizations cost will be affordable. 
### Features

## 4W's and 1'H
### Who:
This will be helpful for different kinds of peoples(students, spokespersons) as well as for some organization(schools, research institutes).  
### What:
Its an Automatic summarization which is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content..
### When:
This system will be helpfull in summarizing downstream applications such as creating news digests, report generation, news summarization, and headline generation.
### Where:
Determine essential ideas and consolidate important details that support them. It enables people to focus on key words and phrases of an assigned text that are worth noting and remembering.
### How:
A NPL will helps in identifying the most important words as well as sentences in the whole document and summarises the document. It inturn helps in reduction in reading time and picks up only the relevant information.
