# Text-summarization

There is an huge amount of textual data, and itâ€™s only growing every single minute. Think of the network which is comprised of several web pages, status, blogs, videos, articles and much more. These kind of data is unstructured and the best thing that we can do is to navigate through the documents then search and skim the results.
