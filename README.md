# Text-summarization
- There is an huge amount of textual data, and itâ€™s only growing every single minute. Think of the network which is comprised of several web pages, status, blogs, videos, articles and much more.
-  These kind of data is unstructured and the best thing that we can do is to navigate through the documents then search and skim the results.Text summarization is the technique for generating a concise and precise summary of voluminous texts while focusing on the sections that convey useful information, and without losing the overall meaning.
-  Automatic text summarization aims to transform lengthy documents into shortened versions, something which could be difficult and costly to undertake if done manually.
Machine learning algorithms can be trained to comprehend documents and identify the sections that convey important facts and information before producing the required summarized texts.
